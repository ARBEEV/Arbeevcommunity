Choose the right chain for creativity. Now there is a blockchain that provides all the facilities.
 
It is impossible to make a new L123 chain. 

Think of blockchain as a house to live in.

Building= make it beautiful=meeting each other's needs=maintaining them well, 

| Don't just build what is important to complete. But maintaining the blockchain is important and together

Whatever is built on web3, choosing the right blockchain can determine the path. select the network where the audience is located 
or want the comfort that is needed. And most importantly, who represents the community, artist or brand, gaming, even content.

Don't follow builds on other blockchain. 
Because the creators and goals are different. But assume motivation and make a difference. 

The goals of each blockchain are also different. Early reading The language resources used are important. Don't apply it straight away.

ARBEEV was formed based on a love of art and motivation as a space for developers, artists, music, video artists, and even poets who cannot be separated from technology and need each other.

# tokenomics
coin 
must include benefits for society in the long term.
not only for the ARBEEV community but for various functions. 
"I won't write here first"

# NFT
a unique asset.

users do not always have to own works built by ARBEEV to be part.
but if you want to have it, go ahead and be the owner. 

# Statement about ARBEEV
Even though we didn't post any problems on social media, even before launching, there were several incidents

Only a few people support and understand 

ARBEEV was founded by someone from friendship. It initially envisioned a motivational entertainment 

He discussed gaming to be played by himself and his friends. 

By establishing this, we aim to house entertainment. 
Although not all buildings are integrated on the blockchain

About the team

Some of our team are always silly and always provide a laugh.

everything he does has an unexpected action that might sound strange at first when he speaks.

Some action that makes laugh 

start from
AI/artificial intelligence

unable to answer some questions. 

It is true that there are still shortcomings, but the advantages are in the word/sentence structure of the statement.

This can be used as material in a speech because the resulting sentences are arranged very neatly

can be used as a matter of debate 
With elegant sentences.
 
we sometimes make mistake mapping sentences and revising papers. 

Sometimes the unexpected/silly is always a good thing.

Maybe it's just strange for those who don't know

After that he did something unexpected again.

in the end the design was a bit complicated and problem

We don't talk about/report that

because of good things.
not necessarily heard well

# As time goes by the team increases
starting from Someone who says more than 12 years of experience in 

he just provides guidance on blockchain philosophy and provides many moments. community creation 

Building is the role of the builder himself. 
and have long-term impacts. etc.

However, he is not from our team and cannot return to help.

Our team doesn't have the same skills.

Even though there is person who doesn't have the skills, we still need and embrace them.

Even so, he was very helpful and we did not consider him a burden 

We all have our own advantages and disadvantages

This meeting was not a coincidence. not looking for employees like a company.

# Controversy
Negative statements to us.

Some say 
uncertainty and, somewhat anciently, greed. 
which is often overshadowed by technical and financial aspects.

We are not as stated.
Not even carrying out promotions to attract investors. 

[It's very easy to do something like that because often there are those who pull the rug/attract early investors by launching tokens, etc.]

We know several events in 2020-2022.
though we are not active on public or media

every incident we learn 
that it is not a correct example.

# Positive statement to us 
Only a few people responded to us 

Some of them said 

Nurture your community Because
Community is at the heart of web3. 
We build together, collect together, and grow together. Nurturing your community is something every content creator on web3 should take seriously.

It's been too long since you've been in the "one of the L1 blockchain" community.
Don't focus on your own community. Nice to see what happens
across all blockchain and calculate potential launches

Sometimes it's worth rushing to catch a wave of interest in a theme.

Get to know the community, where they are, remember to mention your arrival closer to the launch date
And choosing the right blockchain determines the path that is built.

Don't post excessively. Plan posts in advance and grow interest organically.

Your community is the main character of this story. Make sure to lead the narrative.

"You have to consider that there are other interesting things about your community."

Don't be shy Reach out to your other online friends, communities, partners, and even the networks you belong to, and ask for support from them because I'm sure you've done this before. This space is made of friendship and partnership. 

Here are some suggestions we always listen to.

# Creator economy
What is meant here is not only for creators in our environment. 

However, we support independent/individual artists even if they are not part of our community.

# ARBEEV
Inspired by a tree.
And Dragon Ball 1982 by Akira Toriyama

Thank you for making manga that entertain us from our childhood and teenage years. Rest in calm
